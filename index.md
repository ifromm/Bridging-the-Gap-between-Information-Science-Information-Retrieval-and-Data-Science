# Bridging the Gap between Information Science, Information Retrieval and Data Science

## Call For Papers

We are calling for papers to join us on 19th Oct 2019 in Melbourne, Australia. We will be running a workshop called BIRDS - Bridging the Gap between Information Science, Information Retrieval and Data Science, which aims to foster the cross-fertilization of Information Science (IS), Information Retrieval (IR) and Data Science (DS). Recognising the commonalities and differences between these communities, the full-day workshop will bring together experts and researchers in IS, IR and DS to discuss how they can learn from each other to provide user-driven data and information exploration and retrieval solutions. Therefore, we welcome submissions conveying ideas on how to utilise, for instance, IS concepts and theories in DS and IR or DS approaches to support users in data and information exploration. BIRDS will be collocated with the 82th Annual Meeting of ASIS&T 2019 in Melbourne, Australia (https://www.asist.org/am19/). The workshop will be held all day on Saturday 19th Oct 2019.

### Overview

The overarching theme of the BIRDS workshop is to look at how DS, IR and IS can complement each other by applying a more holistic approach to these disciplines that go beyond traditional DS or IR or IS alone. BIRDS aims to extend the scope of current research to provide a more holistic view on data and information in all its quantity, forms and variety and investigate user preferences and interaction.

The cross-fertilization of DS, IR and IS that we want to address in this workshop goes two ways. On the one hand, BIRDS will focus on the utilisation of DS methodologies in IR and IS. On the other hand, we will look at how user-oriented concepts and theories from IS, for instance, Information Foraging Theory or the Principle of Polyrepresentation, can be applied to enhance and complement the data-driven approaches in DS and IR. To this aim, relevant topics of the workshop will be, but are not limited to:

- data and information presentation and visualisation
- user preference and behaviour analysis
- social and collaborative information seeking
- multimedia and multimodal information discovery
- informatics (e.g., bioinformatics and enterprise)
- conversational information retrieval,
- evaluation metrics and reproducibility issues in evaluation
- bibliometrics and IR/NLP
- databases and IR/IS
- interpretability and explainability in machine learning and deep learning, and
- formal models for interactive data and information discovery.

The target audience of the workshop are students, practitioners and researchers in DS, IR and IS, from academia and industry alike.

We plan to invite world-renowned keynote speakers to provide food for thought and inspiration from respected experts in the field of IS, IR and DS. Oral and poster paper presentations will discuss cutting-edge research in the areas relevant to the BIRDS workshop. A planned panel discussion session will investigate whether and how the gap between IS and DS can be bridged through IR, and provide an outlook on future research.

### Submission Guidelines

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their papers orally at the workshop and/or to present them in the interactive poster sessions.
All papers should be formatted in the ACM SIG double-column style.
Suitable LaTeX and Word templates are available from the ACM Website link https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.  
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the programme committee.
If possible, we plan to publish the papers as CEUR Workshop Proceedings.
